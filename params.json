It's pretty tough to remember any of those hex codes though. This Sass partial makes it easy though.\r\n\r\nWhat it does mainly is take all of the colors from http://google.com/design/spec/style/color.html and assigns them all to SCSS variables and classes. Pretty simple stuff.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can call them in two different ways:\r\n```HTML\r\n<div class=\"foo red\"></div>\r\n```\r\nor in SCSS\r\n```SCSS\r\n$[color]-[hue]\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nSo for example, if I wanted use that neat blue-grey color, all I have to do is say:\r\n```SCSS\r\n$blue-grey-500\r\n```\r\nOr I could easily just add the `blue-grey` class to the element:\r\n```HTML\r\n<div class=\"foo blue-grey\"></div>\r\n```\r\nThen you can go up or down by using `lighten` or `darken`:\r\n```HTML\r\n<div class=\"foo blue-grey lighten-2\"></div>\r\n<div class=\"bar blue-grey darken-2\"></div>\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe HTML method applies the background-color property to an element. If you're trying to apply the color to text (use sparingly, it doesn't really fit with the Material theme) just add `-text` to the end of the color's name.\r\n```HTML\r\n<div class=\"foo orange-text\"></div>\r\n```\r\n\r\nAfter moving the file into your project, just include it with a quick,\r\n```SCSS\r\n@include \"material-colors\";\r\n```\r\n==============\r\nComing up with good color palettes for Material apps is easy!\r\n\r\nJust jam together about three different hues from one color palette and pair them with one accent color from a color's secondary palette (A100, A200, A400, A700). That's all there is too it.\r\n\r\nHere's a nice example color palette for an app:\r\n\r\n```HTML\r\n<!-- Primary Color Palette -->\r\n<div class=\"foo indigo\"></div>\r\n<div class=\"bar indigo lighten-4\"></div>\r\n<div class=\"baz indigo darken-2\"></div>\r\n\r\n<!-- Accent Color -->\r\n<div class=\"accent pink lighten-1\"></div>\r\n```\r\nWhile the above isn't **technically** correct regarding Material, it's easier to implement, is a little more elegant, and is pretty close anyways. If you want to get exact, you can always just use the SCSS variables:\r\n\r\n```SCSS\r\n//Primary Color Palette\r\n.foo { background-color: $indigo-500; }\r\n.bar { background-color: $indigo-100; }\r\n.baz { background-color: $indigo-700; }\r\n\r\n//Accent Color\r\n.accent { background-color: $pink-A200; }\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt's really up to you which way you want to go with that.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
