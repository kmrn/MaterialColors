MaterialColors
==============

**A Sass partial for all of Google's Material color palette.**

Liking the colors encouraged by Google's new design spec? It's pretty tough to remember any of those hex codes though. This Sass partial makes it easy though.

What it does mainly is take all of the colors from http://google.com/design/spec/style/colors.html and assigns them all to SCSS variables. Pretty simple stuff.


You can call them like this:

```SCSS
$[color]-[hue]

```

So for example, if I wanted use that neat blue-grey color, all I have to do is say:

```SCSS
$blue-grey-500
```
==============
Coming up with good color palettes for Material apps is easy!

Just jam together about three different hues from one color palette and pair them with one accent color from a color's secondary palette (A100, A200, A400, A700). That's all there is too it.
